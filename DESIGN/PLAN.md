####The Loop's Cheese Salad's Project Plan
* Game Authoring Environment
	* Annie, Stephen, and Amy will work on all elements concerning the Game Authoring environment.  Each team member will work first on implementing all their parts individually and then connecting their parts for debugging together.  
	* Annie intends to work largely on implementing the Game Authoring view classes.  Secondly, she will help on implementing the ImageLibrary and SoundLibrary to contribute to implementing functionalities associated with additional data sources.
	* Stephen intends on largely working on implementing the model classes (the Actor and Level classes).  Secondarily, he will work on the Game Utility (particularly displaying dynamically updated information).
	* Amy will work on implementing the controller classes (dealing with the functionality for what happens on a LevelEditingEnvironment or ActorEditingEnvironment).  Secondarily, she will work on the Game Utility with Stephen (particularly working on the framework for displaying information).
	* In the extension social center, Annie, Stephen, and Amy will work on developing the Social Center’s preferences (including name,  password, etc.) and actions (including viewing personal high scores, etc.) for users.

* Game Engine
	* Michelle and Justin will work on the physics engine and collision detection
	* Blake and Colette will work on implementing the Actors, Actions, Level, and Game
	* The team will work on getting all Game Engine components done early so that they will be able to debug them with the other project subteams.
	* The team has set aside specific Actions to be implemented. Among these Actions are MoveUp, MoveDown, MoveRight, MoveLeft, Jump, Start, Stop, Destroy, and others
	* In the extension social center, this team will work on the social aspects of player collaboration and chatting.

* Game Player and Data
	* The team will complete the program by first focusing on implementing the view package so that way we can debug our program’s code in earlier stages of development. 
	* Carine will take primary responsibility for the XML data parsers and the controllers transferring this information with the GameAuthoringEnvironment and GameEngine. In addition, she will contribute to saving user’s progress and seeing the available games in the environment. 
	* Bobby will focus on implementing the high score capability and assisting with actions on the splash screen.  Secondarily, he will help implement the user interface functionalities (i.e. the button functionalities) with the views.
	* Michael intends to work on implementing the views and adding functionality to the game screen with attention to the HUD and game switching. His secondary responsibilities include high level game operations like resetting or changing levels.
	* In terms of extensions, the social center feature will be implemented in this project by adding online sharing capabilities to the high score component and collectively working on connecting a central database for these files. 

###### Note: we plan on doing a lot of pair programming within the subteams, thus, the responsibilities are likely to be variable or become quite overlapped between members of the same subteam.
