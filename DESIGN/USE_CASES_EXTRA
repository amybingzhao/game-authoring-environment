 - Main character jumps in the air when space bar is clicked
	 - GameScreen detects a key press, creates a KeyPress trigger instatiated with KeyCode.SPACE and notifies GameController, passing it the KeyTrigger trigger
	 - GameController receives a notification to handleTrigger(KeyTrigger(SPACE)), so it tells Game to handleTrigger(KeyPress(SPACE))
	 - Game tells the current level to handleTrigger() on a KeyTrigger of type SPACE
	 - Level retrieves the list of actors with a SpaceKeyTrigger trigger from its myTriggerMap and for each of them, performsActionsFor() the space key trigger
 - Main character walks into block and bounces off of it Main character
	 - actor must contain a Rule mapping a SideCollision (instatiated with mainCharacter and block) trigger to a HorizontalBounceCollision action In Game class, collisionDetector detects collision between main character actor and block actor  
	 - In CollisionDetection class, side collision is detected and signals main character actorâ€™s performActionsFor() method for a side collision between the maincharacter actor and the block actor 
	 - The main character performs the HorizontalBounceCollision action to bounce backwards off the block
